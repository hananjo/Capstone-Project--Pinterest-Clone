# Project Summary:

This project is a Pinterest clone, aiming to replicate the core features and user experience of this popular website. This platform provides a vision board type experience where the user can find pictures that they find both inspiring and visulally appealing. The user can discover and save pins into a custom created board. Users may also leave comments on pins they like. One notable element, which makes the user experience much more powerful, is the search feature. Users have the ability to search for keywords that are associated with the pins they desire to see.
